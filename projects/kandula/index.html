          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Investing is hard. Only <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3423101">3 percent</a> of day-traders make a profit. 
            However, there is a whole body of research going into algorithms that outperform the market. The algorithms that perform well are conceptually simple,
            but not necessarily easy to implement. With Kandula, you trade algorithms instead of companies. 
            You can find a myriad of trading algorithms that are open-source and easily customizable (without code!). 
            With this project, I hope to provide a proof-of-concept to reduce barriers to algorithmic trading.

            <h3>Free Algorithm Hosting</h3>
            <p>
              With Kandula, the size of our project is small enough that (for the time being) we can provide free hosting for all user algorithms.
              So, once you add an algorithm to your portfolio, we will host it on the cloud so that it will make trades for you.
            </p>

            <h3>Open-source Code</h3>
            <p>
              The code for the user-interface is freely available on the <a href="https://github.com/samacqua/AlgoTrading">github</a>, 
              and the backend code for running the algorithms also has a <a href="https://github.com/samacqua/AlgoTradingBackend">github</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>No-code tunable algorithms</h3>
            <p>
              You can easily customize the provided algorithms, without code, by varying different parameters. 
            </p>

            <h3>Backtesting</h3>
            <p>
              You can test that your customized algorithm works and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backtesting.asp">backtest</a> it using our freely provided historical data.
            </p>

            <h3>Connect to Alpaca <strike>and Robinhood</strike> account</h3>
            <p>
              Once you tune and test an algorithm, you can let it make trades using your Alpaca and (not Robinhood because the API has changed) accounts.
            </p>


          <h2>Download</h2>
          <p>
            You can download via the project's <a href="https://github.com/samacqua/AlgoTrading">github</a>.

          <h2>FAQs</h2>
          <h3>What is the meaning of "Kandula"?</h3>
            <p>
              <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2001/12/15/a-regal-choice-kandula/d84c6ad2-2d40-477f-9a80-951c68579d70/">Kandula</a> is the name of an elephant in Sri Lankan legends.
              Kandula was a battle elephant known for its wisdom and courage, bringing success to the Sri Lankan prince Dutugemunu. 
              I hope that this app can be to individual investors what the elephant was to Dutugemunu -- a source of wisdom in the battle of investing.
            </p>

          <h3>What is the motivation for Kandula?</h3>
            <p>
              At the beginning of 2020, my family and friends all lost a significant amount of money in the stock market.
              Fearing that the market would collapse, they sold stocks at inopportune times. If they had traded with more robust
              strategy (or reacted quicker to stock price changes) they could have avoided these losses. I wanted to give them 
              a tool to trade smarter, without having to learn to code or analyze stocks on a daily basis.
